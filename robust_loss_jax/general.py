r"""Implements the general form of the loss.

This is the simplest way of using this loss. No parameters will be tuned
automatically, it's just a simple function that takes in parameters (likely
hand-tuned ones) and return a loss. For an adaptive loss, look at adaptive.py
or distribution.py.

  r"""Implements the general form of the loss.

  This implements the rho(x, \alpha, c) function described in "A General and
  Adaptive Robust Loss Function", Jonathan T. Barron,
  https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03077.

  Args:
    x: The residual for which the loss is being computed. x can have any shape,
      and alpha and scale will be broadcasted to match x's shape if necessary.
    alpha: The shape parameter of the loss (\alpha in the paper), where more
      negative values produce a loss with more robust behavior (outliers "cost"
      less), and more positive values produce a loss with less robust behavior
      (outliers are penalized more heavily). Alpha can be any value in
      [-infinity, infinity], but the gradient of the loss with respect to alpha
      is 0 at -infinity, infinity, 0, and 2. Varying alpha allows for smooth
      interpolation between several discrete robust losses:
        alpha=-Infinity: Welsch/Leclerc Loss.
        alpha=-2: Geman-McClure loss.
        alpha=0: Cauchy/Lortentzian loss.
        alpha=1: Charbonnier/pseudo-Huber loss.
        alpha=2: L2 loss.
    scale: The scale parameter of the loss. When |x| < scale, the loss is an
      L2-like quadratic bowl, and when |x| > scale the loss function takes on a
      different shape according to alpha.

  Returns:
    The losses for each element of x, in the same shape as x.
