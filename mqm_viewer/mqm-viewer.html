This is a web app that loads a translation quality evaluation data file from a
Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) evaluation and provides various computed
scores from the data. The interface allows the user to slice and dice the data
by applying various filters. A data file can be loaded by using the
"Choose file" button.

To use this, you need to serve the files mqm-viewer.{html,js,css} (either from
a web server, or just locally using file:// URLs).

The data file should have tab-separated UTF-8-encoded data with the following
nine columns, one line per marked error:

  system: Name of the translation system.
  doc: Name of the document.
  doc_id: Id of segment (sentence or group of sentences) within the document.
  seg_id: Id of segment across all documents.
  rater: Rater who evaluated segment.
  source: Source text for segment.
  target: Translated text for segment.
  category: MQM error category (or "no-error").
  severity: MQM error severity (or "no-error").

Optionally, some rows may have a tenth entry, which is a note left by the rater.
  note: Note left by rater, typically in 'Other' category.

An optional header line in the data file will be ignored (identified by the
presence of the text "system\tdoc").

Example data files and details on score computations can be found here:
