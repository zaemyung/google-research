# Vocoder evaluation on VCTK data.
VCTK data [license](https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10283/3443/license_text?sequence=3&isAllowed=y)
|  Audio files      | Description  |
| ---------------- | --------------------- |
|[input](vctk/input) | Input data containing both clean and noisy audio clips from VCTK data.     |
|[causal](vctk/causal) | Outputs generated by *causal* streaming neural vocoder.  |
|[lookahead_1](vctk/lookahead_1) | Outputs generated by *lookahead_1* streaming neural vocoder with one hop lookahead.  |
|[lookahead_12](vctk/lookahead_12) | Outputs generated by *lookahead_12* streaming neural vocoder with 12 hops lookahead.  |
|[non_stream_gl_I3](vctk/non_stream_gl_I3) | Outputs generated by *non_stream_gl_I3* non streaming Griffin Lim with 3 iterations.  |
|[non_stream_gl_I70](vctk/non_stream_gl_I70) | Outputs generated by *non_stream_gl_I70* non streaming Griffin Lim with 70 iterations.  |
|[stream_gl_S4I4C2](vctk/stream_gl_S4I4C2) | Outputs generated by *stream_gl_S4I4C2* streaming aware Griffin Lim with 4 iterations and sliding window size 4. |

We preserved audio clip names from VCTK dataset.

# Parrotron evaluation on atypical speech (Deaf) with different vocoders.
|  Audio files      | Description  |
| ---------------- | --------------------- |
|[input](atypical_speech/input) | Input audio data.     |
|[lookahead_1](atypical_speech/lookahead_1) | Outputs generated by Parrotron + *lookahead_1* streaming neural vocoder with one hop lookahead.  |
|[non_stream_gl_I70](atypical_speech/non_stream_gl_I70) | Outputs generated by Parrotron + *non_stream_gl_I70* non streaming Griffin Lim with 70 iterations.  |
|[stream_gl_S4I4C2](atypical_speech/stream_gl_S4I4C2) | Outputs generated by Parrotron + *stream_gl_S4I4C2* streaming aware Griffin Lim with 4 iterations and sliding window size 4. |
