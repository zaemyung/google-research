Each Molecule can have multiple bond topologies associated with it

Most Molecules (~96%) have exactly one bond topology like this one
Molecule 57429002 has 1 bond topologies
    Topology with id 57429 and SMILES COC=NC#N
        is_starting_topology: True

Some Molecules have multiple bond topologies like this one
Molecule 8400001 has 2 bond topologies
    Topology with id 8405 and SMILES O=[N+]1ON1O[O-]
    Topology with id 8400 and SMILES [O-][N+]12OON1O2
        is_starting_topology: True
For Molecules with multiple topologies one will generally be marked
with is_starting_topology, indicating that this is the topology
that was used during the initial geometry generation

However, the same topology id can be present multiple times for a given Molecule
For example, consider good old benzene
Molecule 79488001 has 2 bond topologies
    Topology with id 79488 and SMILES C1=CC=CC=C1
    Topology with id 79488 and SMILES C1=CC=CC=C1
        is_starting_topology: True
These are the two kekulized forms of benzene
While the final graphs are isomorphic, for a given pair of carbons, the bond types are switched
The first bond topology has
atom_a: 1
atom_b: 3
bond_type: BOND_DOUBLE
and the second bond topology has
atom_a: 1
atom_b: 3
bond_type: BOND_SINGLE

There are also some cases with a mix of same and different ids, like this
Molecule 3177001 has 3 bond topologies
    Topology with id 3177 and SMILES C1N2NN1O2
        is_starting_topology: True
    Topology with id 2805 and SMILES [O-][N+]12CN1N2
    Topology with id 2805 and SMILES [O-][N+]12CN1N2

There are also a handful of special cases that have no topology marked
with is_starting_topology. These have exactly one bond topology and
1 or 2 heavy atoms
Molecule 899650001 has 1 bond topologies
    Topology with id 899650 and SMILES O
Molecule 899651001 has 1 bond topologies
    Topology with id 899651 and SMILES N
Molecule 899652001 has 1 bond topologies
    Topology with id 899652 and SMILES C
Those are all the cases in the standard database
There are a couple more in the complete database
